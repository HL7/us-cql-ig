US Core defines [US Core MedicationRequest]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore6}}/StructureDefinition-us-core-medicationrequest.html) to record a patient's medication prescription or order, as well as self-reported medications.

MedicationRequest can either use a code which will be RXNORM plus an optional NDC (https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1010.4/expansion), or use a reference to a more detailed Medication resource (which also uses RXNORM plus optional NDC).

### Modifier Elements

The MedicationRequest resource defines the following modifier elements:

* status
* intent
* doNotPerform

In addition to being modifiers, the `status` and `intent` elements are required with a required binding. The USCoreCommon library defines several functions for determining status and intent.

However, `doNotPerform` is not required, so care must be taken to ensure that if specified, the `doNotPerform` element is respected.

### Search Parameters

USCore defines the following mandatory search parameters:

* patient, intent
* patient, intent, status

In addition, the following optional parameters are defined:

* patient, intent, encounter
* patient, intent, authoredOn

> NOTE: For discussion on how to manage search parameters with terminology, see the [Terminology Considerations](architectural-guidance.html#terminology-considerations) discussion in the Architectural Guidance topic.

> NOTE: For discussion on how to manage optional search parameters, see the [Performant Data Access](architectural-guidance.html#performant-data-access) discussion in the Architectural Guidance topic.

### Cross-Version Considerations

Although newer versions of USCore introduce additional capability through new elements, there are no significant backwards compatibility issues associated with using the 3.1.1 version.

### Common Elements and Functions

#### Active Medications

> NOTE: In the [prior auth use case](use-case-pa.html), the workflow is generally being conducted in the context of 1 or more orders, so you'll want to start by working off that context before searching the FHIR server for medication requests.

<!--
> TODO: in UCE we want a few wrappers for common things people would want from a MedicationRequest (procedure code, who/where requested it, who/where is performing it), however these are currently built on ```UCE."Most Recent MedicationRequest"``` which could be pulling the wrong data. We need our functions structured to support working on the data in context during DTR.
-->

To get all medications, ```UCE."All Medication Requests"``` can be used. To filter it down to active medications, ```UCE."Active Medication Orders"``` can be used.

#### Electronically Transmitted Prescriptions

The US Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) implementation guide defines an extension that supports identifying the transmission method for a prescription, the [PDMP Rx Transmission Method extension](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/pdmp/STU1/StructureDefinition-pdmp-extension-rx-transmission-method.html).


The USCoreCommon library provides the following declarations to support this element:

```cql
codesystem "Rx Transmission Method": 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/PMIXTransmissionFormRxOriginCodeType'

code "Written Prescription": 'Written Prescription' from "Rx Transmission Method" display 'Written Prescription'
code "Electronic Prescription": 'Electronic Prescription' from "Rx Transmission Method" display 'Electronic Prescription'

define fluent function transmissionMethod(medicationDispense MedicationDispense):
  medicationDispense.ext('http://hl7.org/fhir/us/pdmp/StructureDefinition/pdmp-extension-rx-transmission-method').value as Coding
```

With these declarations, a quality improvement artifact could look for evidence of an electronic transmission with the following:

```cql
define "Electronically Transmitted Prescriptions":
  [MedicationDispense] Prescription
    where Prescription.transmissionMethod() ~ "Electronic Prescription"
```
