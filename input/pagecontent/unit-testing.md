> This page is a **proposal** for a refined approach to unit testing shareable CQL assets. It responds to balloter feedback that the initial test-case model described on the [Testing](testing.html) page is too limited to support a common asset library. It is presented for discussion; the assertion model described here is not yet normative, and tooling support is under development. Feedback is welcome via the [Propose a Change](https://jira.hl7.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10405&issuetype=10600&customfield_11302=FHIR-us-cql) process.

### Motivation

The [Testing](testing.html) page describes a straightforward unit-testing pattern: for each test case, a folder of FHIR resources represents a single patient's data, and an `expected-results` `Parameters` resource records the expected value of each expression by name. Values are compared for **exact equality**. This model is easy to author in the [VSCode CQL Plugin](https://github.com/cqframework/vscode-cql) and works well for static, deterministic checks (e.g., "does `Patient Name` return `Peter James Chalmers`").

However, exact-equality-against-static-data does not scale to a suite of tests that must validate CQL intended for reuse across many implementations and against real, messy EHR data. Four problems in particular were raised in balloting, and this proposal is organized around addressing them:

1. **Relative timing.** Example resources carry static instants (e.g., `Observation.effectiveDateTime = "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"`), but clinically the CQL usually asks a *relative* question ("was this observation resulted in the last 7 days?"). The answer depends on *when the test is evaluated*. Without a way to pin the evaluation time, the expected result is either non-deterministic or silently wrong.
2. **Robustness to data variation.** Shared assets must tolerate a variety of valid representations — different units, different choice-type serializations (`effectiveDateTime` vs. `effectivePeriod`), missing optional elements. Tests need to exercise these variants rather than assume one canonical shape.
3. **Floating-point and unit sensitivity.** Any computation (unit conversion, `CalculateBSA`, ratios) can produce `6.01 mg/dL` where a naive author wrote `6`. Exact decimal comparison makes such a test brittle and, worse, encourages authors to hard-code an engine's rounding behavior.
4. **Partial matches over complex results.** When an expression returns a list or a structured object, the point of the test is often that *some* relevant element is included or excluded — not that the entire result matches a fixture byte-for-byte.

The balloter's summary requirement is that assertions must consider: (1) a data type together with comparisons that are meaningful *for that type*; (2) both positive and negated assertions; (3) relative timing; and (4) partial matching of a complex object or list. This proposal adopts those four criteria directly.

### Review of Existing Testing Architectures

Rather than invent a vocabulary from scratch, this proposal draws on established unit-testing frameworks and existing CQL/FHIR testing tooling.

| Architecture | Relevant ideas we borrow |
|---|---|
| **Assertion libraries (e.g., Chai, JUnit/Hamcrest, pytest)** | A *matcher* vocabulary that is organized by the type of value under test: `expect(x).to.equal(y)`, `expect(x).to.be.greaterThan(y)`, `expect(x).to.contain(y)`, `expect(x).to.have.property(p).with.lengthOf(n)`, `expect(x).to.not.equal(y)`, `expect(x).to.be.closeTo(y, delta)`. Every matcher has a negated form (`.not`), and matchers are only offered where they type-check. |
| **[CQL Testing Framework](https://github.com/AHRQ-CDS/CQL-Testing-Framework)** | A YAML test-case format layered over Mocha/Chai that already supports fixing the execution date and asserting expression results. Demonstrates that a human-authorable, non-programmer-friendly surface syntax over a rich matcher set is workable for CQL. |
| **FHIR [TestScript](https://hl7.org/fhir/testscript.html)/[TestReport](https://hl7.org/fhir/testreport.html)** | A FHIR-native way to express assertions (`assert.operator` = `equals`, `greaterThan`, `contains`, `in`, `notEquals`, …) and to record pass/fail as a resource. Confirms that an operator-plus-expected-value model is idiomatic in the FHIR ecosystem. |
| **[CRMI](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi) test packaging** | How test cases travel with content artifacts as bundles, and how expected results are conveyed as `Parameters`. This proposal keeps that packaging so existing tooling and the [Downloads](downloads.html) distribution continue to work. |

The consistent lesson across these is that a robust assertion is a triple: **(value under test, operator, expected value)** — optionally with a tolerance — where the available operators are constrained by the *type* of the value under test, and every operator has a negation.

### Proposed Test-Case Model

The proposal extends the existing `Parameters`-based expected-results file in two ways, both backward compatible:

1. A **test context** section that fixes the evaluation timestamp (and any input parameters) for the test case, so relative timing is deterministic.
2. An **assertion** representation that replaces the bare `name`/`value` pair with a `name` (the expression under test), an `operator`, an `expected` value, and optional `tolerance`/`path` parts.

A plain `name`/`value` pair (today's format) continues to be interpreted as `operator = equals`, so all existing test cases remain valid.

#### 1. Test context and relative timing

Each test case gains an optional evaluation context. The engine evaluates `Now()` and `Today()` as the supplied `evaluationDateTime` instead of the wall clock, making every relative expression deterministic regardless of when the suite runs.

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "id": "test-context",
  "parameter": [
    { "name": "evaluationDateTime", "valueDateTime": "2026-01-08T12:00:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

With the evaluation time pinned to `2026-01-08`, an `Observation` with `effectiveDateTime = "2026-01-01"` is exactly 7 days old, so a test of "resulted in the last 7 days" is stable. Fixtures should be authored **relative to a documented anchor date**, and the anchor is declared here — not left implicit in the resource files. Where a test intends to probe a boundary (7 days vs. 8 days), authors provide two fixtures that straddle it and pin the evaluation time so the boundary falls between them.

This directly enables tests of the timing-sensitive US Core elements in this IG. For example, `USCoreElements.ageInDays()` is defined in terms of `Now()`/`Today()`:

> *Given* a `Patient` with `birthDate = "2026-01-01"` and an evaluation time of `2026-01-08`, `ageInDays()` **equals** `7`.

Because the evaluation time is fixed by the test context rather than the clock, this assertion is reproducible.

#### 2. Type-aware, negatable assertions

An assertion names the expression under test, an operator, and an expected value:

```json
{
  "name": "Age In Days",
  "part": [
    { "name": "operator", "valueCode": "equals" },
    { "name": "expected", "valueInteger": 7 }
  ]
}
```

The operator vocabulary is organized by the type of the value under test. Tooling should only offer (and only accept) operators that are valid for the result type of the expression, satisfying criterion (1). Every operator is negatable via a `negated` part (`valueBoolean: true`), satisfying criterion (2).

| Applies to | Operators | Chai analogue |
|---|---|---|
| Any type | `equals`, `isNull`, `exists` | `.equal`, `.be.null`, `.exist` |
| Numeric, `Quantity`, Date/Time (ordered) | `greaterThan`, `greaterOrEqual`, `lessThan`, `lessOrEqual`, `between` | `.be.greaterThan`, `.be.at.least`, `.be.within` |
| Decimal / `Quantity` (inexact) | `approximately` (requires `tolerance`) | `.be.closeTo` |
| `String` | `matches` (regex), `startsWith`, `contains` (substring) | `.match`, `.include` |
| List / collection | `includes`, `containsAll`, `containsAny`, `isEmpty`, `lengthOf`, `countGreaterThan` | `.include`, `.have.members`, `.be.empty`, `.have.lengthOf` |
| `Tuple` / FHIR structure | `hasProperty` (with nested assertion via `path`), `matchesPartial` | `.have.property(p)` |

Because operators are gated by type, a test cannot ask whether a `String` is `greaterThan` a list, nor whether an `Integer` `includes` a value — mirroring how Chai matchers are only meaningful for the value's type. Negation lets a test assert, for example, that an expression **does not equal** a sentinel, or that a list **does not include** a resource that ought to have been filtered out.

#### 3. Tolerance for floating-point and units

For any computed decimal or `Quantity`, the `approximately` operator compares within an explicit `tolerance` rather than by exact equality, satisfying criterion (3). Authors declare the precision the test actually cares about instead of transcribing an engine's rounding.

This is exactly what `USCoreElements.CalculateBSA` needs — a Mosteller BSA is a square root of a ratio and will not land on a round decimal:

```json
{
  "name": "Body Surface Area (Mosteller)",
  "part": [
    { "name": "operator",  "valueCode": "approximately" },
    { "name": "expected",  "valueQuantity": { "value": 1.9, "unit": "m2" } },
    { "name": "tolerance", "valueQuantity": { "value": 0.01, "unit": "m2" } }
  ]
}
```

> *Given* a patient with `Height = 43.9 [in_i]` and `Weight`, `CalculateBSA('Mosteller', Height, Weight)` **is approximately** `1.9 m2` within `0.01 m2`.

Because the expected value and the result carry units, the comparison is **unit-aware**: the tooling normalizes to comparable UCUM units before applying the tolerance, so a result expressed in `cm2` still matches an expectation in `m2`. This also addresses the "different units" aspect of criterion (2): a fixture may legitimately record height in inches or centimeters, and the same assertion holds.

#### 4. Partial matching over lists and complex objects

When an expression returns a list, the meaningful assertion is frequently about membership, not equality of the whole list. The `includes`/`containsAll`/`containsAny` operators take an expected element described by a **partial template** — only the discriminating elements are specified, and a result element matches if it contains at least those, satisfying criterion (4).

Consider the balloter's example: given a patient whose renal function is normal (or not), an expression returns the set of `MedicationRequest`s that should be included. A good test asserts that the output **includes** the request that must be present and **excludes** the one that must be filtered — without asserting anything about the rest of the set:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Included Medication Requests",
    "part": [
      { "name": "operator", "valueCode": "includes" },
      { "name": "expected", "resource": {
          "resourceType": "MedicationRequest",
          "identifier": [{ "system": "http://example.org/rx", "value": "nizatidine-continue" }]
      } }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Included Medication Requests",
    "part": [
      { "name": "operator", "valueCode": "includes" },
      { "name": "negated",  "valueBoolean": true },
      { "name": "expected", "resource": {
          "resourceType": "MedicationRequest",
          "identifier": [{ "system": "http://example.org/rx", "value": "contraindicated-renal" }]
      } }
    ]
  }
]
```

Here the two assertions together say "the result **includes** the continuing therapy **and does not include** the renally-contraindicated request," while remaining silent about any other members — so the test does not break when unrelated requests are added to the fixture. `hasProperty` with a `path` provides the same partial-match capability for a single structured result (assert one property of a returned `Tuple`/resource, leaving the rest unconstrained), which is the CQL analogue of `expect(x).to.have.property(y).with.lengthOf(z)`.

### Worked Example: US Core Elements

Bringing the pieces together for the IG's own artifacts, a refined test case for `USCoreElements` reads as a set of natural-language expectations that each map to one assertion:

- *Given* a patient born `2026-01-01`, evaluated as of `2026-01-08` → `ageInDays()` **equals** `7`; `ageInYears()` **equals** `0`.
- *Given* the same patient → `ageInDays()` **is not** null.
- *Given* height `43.9 [in_i]` and a body-weight `Observation` → `CalculateBSA('Mosteller', Height, Weight)` **is approximately** `1.9 m2 ± 0.01`.
- *Given* height recorded in `cm` instead of `[in_i]` → the same BSA assertion still holds (unit-aware).
- *Given* a patient with three active medications, one contraindicated → "Included Medications" **includes** the two safe requests and **does not include** the contraindicated one.

Each bullet is one `(expression, operator, expected)` triple; together they exercise relative timing, tolerance, unit variation, and partial list matching without depending on the wall-clock or on an engine's rounding.

Concrete drafts of these test cases are available in the source repository as a starting point for discussion and for the enhanced runner:

- `input/tests/library/USCoreElementsTests/refined-age-in-days` — relative timing (`ageInDays`/`ageInYears`), with a pinned `evaluationDateTime`
- `input/tests/library/USCoreElementsTests/refined-bsa` — tolerant, unit-aware floating-point comparison (`CalculateBSA`, Mosteller and DuBois)
- `input/tests/library/USCoreElementsTests/refined-active-medications` — partial list include/exclude (`Active Medication Orders`)
- `input/tests/library/USCoreCommonTests/refined-demographics` — type-aware equality, negation, and partial `Coding` matching (`birthSex`, `race`)

The test expressions these cases assert against are declared in `USCoreElementsTests.cql` and `USCoreCommonTests.cql` under the "Refined unit test demonstration" headings. See the [refined-tests README](https://github.com/HL7/us-cql-ig/tree/main/input/tests/library) for the per-case expected values and how each maps to a proposal criterion.

### Backward Compatibility and Next Steps

- **Compatibility.** A `name`/`value` parameter with no `operator` part continues to mean `equals`, so every existing `expected-results` file remains a valid test case. The `test-context` resource is optional; test cases that do not use relative timing are unaffected.
- **Packaging.** Test cases continue to travel as resource folders and packaged bundles per [CRMI](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi), distributed via the [Downloads](downloads.html) page, so the distribution model on the [Testing](testing.html) page is unchanged.
- **Concrete drafts.** The `refined-*` test cases referenced above are provided as illustrative drafts of the format. They are not yet executed by the current test runner (which performs exact-equality on `name`/`value` pairs); they seed the enhanced runner and give the working group concrete material to react to.
- **Authoring surface.** The `Parameters` representation above is the on-disk/interchange form. A more concise human-authoring surface (a Chai-style fluent form, or the YAML used by the [CQL Testing Framework](https://github.com/AHRQ-CDS/CQL-Testing-Framework)) can compile to it, and is the expected day-to-day authoring experience in the [VSCode CQL Plugin](https://github.com/cqframework/vscode-cql).
- **Reporting.** Results should be emitted as a machine-readable report (aligned with FHIR [TestReport](https://hl7.org/fhir/testreport.html)) so that CI can gate on pass/fail per assertion.
- **Open questions for discussion.** (a) The exact operator code system and whether to reuse `TestScript` assertion operators; (b) how `matchesPartial` semantics should treat list-valued elements within a template (any-match vs. all-match); (c) whether `tolerance` should also support relative (percentage) tolerance in addition to absolute.
