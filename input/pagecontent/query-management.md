> NOTE: The guidance in this section discusses several options for accessing data more broadly when more specific capabilities are not available. As much as possible, these fallback retrieval patterns should be bounded by clinical context, measurement or prior authorization period, resource type, and supported search parameters, and should avoid broad payer-driven data sweeps where targeted queries are available.

### Overview

All data access within CQL is expressed abstractly, using the [Retrieve](https://cql.hl7.org/02-authorsguide.html#retrieve) expression, and surfaced from a packaged Library as `dataRequirement` elements. These data requirements describe _what_ data the logic needs, independent of _how_ any particular server exposes it. A DTR-style client that evaluates CQL must bridge that gap: translating abstract data requirements into concrete FHIR searches, executing them against a server whose capabilities vary, and shaping the results so the CQL engine can evaluate the logic correctly.

_Query management_ is the collection of techniques and helper functions used to bridge that gap. This topic complements the [Initial Data Retrieval](architectural-guidance.html#initial-data-retrieval) discussion in the [Architectural Guidance](architectural-guidance.html) topic, which describes how the effective data requirements for a specific set of expressions are determined; the guidance here focuses on turning those requirements into robust, performant queries against real-world servers.

A recurring theme throughout is the separation between _correctness_ and _optimization_: query management techniques such as `_elements` filtering, `_include`, and less-selective search parameters change how data is retrieved, but the CQL logic must remain correct regardless of which technique is used. When a technique cannot be supported by a given server, the data-access layer should fall back to a more broadly supported query and, where necessary, filter locally, rather than allowing the result of the logic to change.

<a name="optional-server-side-parameters"> </a>
### Optional Server-Side Parameters

The search parameter used to satisfy a given retrieve may vary depending on the capabilities of the server being accessed. Many US Core search parameters are optional (for example, the `code` parameter for `Condition`), so a query that is ideal against one server may not be supported by another.

This situation, and the use of a [Module Configuration Library]({{site.data.fhir.ver.crmi}}/StructureDefinition-crmi-moduleconfigurationlibrary.html) to provide alternative FHIR queries, is described in the [Performant Data Access](architectural-guidance.html#performant-data-access) discussion in the Architectural Guidance topic. In summary, when a preferred search parameter is unavailable, a less-selective filter can be used (for example `category=problem-list-item` in place of `code`) followed by local filtering in the CQL, at the cost of transferring more data.

Related to this, terminology-based filters (the `:in` modifier used to filter a retrieve by value set) are also optional server capabilities. The [Terminology Considerations](architectural-guidance.html#terminology-considerations) discussion describes the approaches available when a server cannot perform value set membership filtering server-side, including choosing a less-selective filter or in-lining an expansion of the value set codes.

### Modifier Elements and Extensions

Because modifier elements and modifier extensions can change the overall meaning of a resource, any resource retrieved for evaluation should be considered with respect to these elements before the data is used.

This is discussed in detail in the [Element Considerations](patterns-overall.html#element-considerations) section of the [Overall Patterns](patterns-overall.html) topic:

* [Modifier Elements](patterns-overall.html#modifier-elements): For each modifier element (for example, `Condition.clinicalStatus`), authors must consider whether each possible value would impact the intent of the expression. The `USCoreCommon` library provides fluent functions such as `.allergyActive()` and `.allergyConfirmed()` for filtering based on these status elements.
* [Modifier Extensions](patterns-overall.html#modifier-extensions): A resource that carries a modifier extension that is not understood cannot be safely processed. The [`checkModifiers()`](https://hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html#functions) function can be used within CQL to ensure that either no modifier extensions are present, or that only expected modifier extensions are present.
* [ImplicitRules](patterns-overall.html#implicitrules): The `implicitRules` element is a modifier element that, if present, must be understood. A `checkImplicitRules()` function can be used to guard against unexpected implicit rules.

From a query management perspective, these checks can be performed either in the CQL logic itself, or as part of the surrounding application environment (for example, by validating retrieved resources before handing them to the CQL engine). Best practice is to be explicit about where the responsibility lies so that unexpected modifiers cause a clear error rather than silently altering the result of the logic.

<a name="include-and-revinclude"> </a>
### _include and _revInclude

CQL logic frequently traverses references between resources. For example, a `MedicationRequest` may reference a `Medication` resource through `medicationReference`, or an `Observation` may reference the `Specimen` from which it was collected. When data requirements analysis reveals such a traversal, the data-access layer has two broad choices for retrieving the referenced resources:

1. Issue a separate query for the referenced resources (for example, retrieve the `MedicationRequest` resources, collect the referenced `Medication` ids, then query for those `Medication` resources).
2. Use the `_include` search parameter to ask the server to return the referenced resources alongside the primary results in a single round-trip.

For example, to retrieve medication requests together with their referenced medications:

```
[base]/MedicationRequest?subject=Patient/123&_include=MedicationRequest:medication
```

The `_revinclude` parameter handles the reverse direction — retrieving resources that _reference_ the primary results. This is useful when the logic needs, for example, the `Provenance` resources that reference the retrieved data, or the `Observation` resources that reference a retrieved `Specimen`:

```
[base]/Specimen?subject=Patient/123&_revinclude=Observation:specimen
```

Guidance for managing `_include` and `_revInclude`:

* **Prefer `_include`/`_revInclude` when a reference traversal is present in the data requirements**, as it reduces the number of round-trips to the server and avoids a second query that depends on the results of the first.
* **Not all servers support every `_include`/`_revInclude` target.** The set of supported includes is advertised in the server's `CapabilityStatement` (`rest.resource.searchInclude` and `searchRevInclude`). When a target is not supported, fall back to issuing separate queries.
* **Contained references do not require an include.** When a referenced resource is contained within the referencing resource, it is already present and no additional query or include is needed. Logic that follows references should account for both contained and external references (the `.references()` function in the shared libraries handles this distinction).
* **Watch for over-retrieval.** A broad `_revinclude` can pull back a large number of resources; where only a specific reference is of interest, prefer a targeted include over `_revinclude=*`.

As with other query management techniques, the choice between separate queries and includes is an optimization: the CQL logic must produce the same result regardless of which approach is used.

<a name="element-filtering"> </a>
### _element Filtering

Because data requirements analysis can determine precisely which elements of a resource the CQL logic accesses, a client can use the [`_elements`](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#elements) search parameter to request only those elements from the server, reducing the size of the payload that must be transferred and parsed:

```
[base]/Observation?subject=Patient/123&category=laboratory&_elements=status,code,value,effective
```

This can be a meaningful optimization for resources with large or numerous elements that the logic does not use. However, several considerations apply:

* **`_elements` is a hint, not a guarantee.** A server may return more elements than requested. In particular, servers are expected to always return mandatory elements and any modifier elements, regardless of the `_elements` value, so that the returned resources remain safe to process.
* **Always include the elements needed for correctness.** In addition to the elements the logic reads directly, the requested set must include any modifier elements and `implicitRules` (see [Modifier Elements and Extensions](#modifier-elements-and-extensions)) so that the guard checks can be performed. Omitting these to save payload would undermine correctness.
* **Resources may be tagged `SUBSETTED`.** When a server honors `_elements`, it flags the returned resources with the `SUBSETTED` tag to indicate that they are not complete representations. These resources should not be persisted back as if they were complete.
* **Correctness must not depend on `_elements`.** As with the other techniques described here, `_elements` is purely an optimization. If a server ignores the parameter and returns full resources, the logic must still evaluate correctly.

<a name="version-differences-among-servers"> </a>
### Version Differences Among Servers

CQL-based artifacts are commonly evaluated against a range of servers that differ along several dimensions. Query management must account for each:

* **US Core version differences.** Systems in the field support different versions of US Core (for example, moving from 3.1.1 through 6.1.0 and 7.0.0). Newer versions generally add profiles rather than change the representation of existing ones, but there are exceptions. These are called out per resource type in the _Cross-Version Considerations_ sections of the [Patterns](patterns.html) topic (for example, [Observation Cross-Version Considerations](patterns-observation.html#cross-version-considerations)). Where an element or extension changed across versions, the shared libraries provide forward- and backward-compatible functions — for example, `USCoreCommon` exposes both the deprecated `.sex()` function and the forward-compatible `.individualSex()` function so that logic can be written once and evaluated against either representation.
* **FHIR server search capability differences.** Servers differ in which search parameters, terminology filters, and includes they support, as described in [Optional Server-Side Parameters](#optional-server-side-parameters) and [_include and _revInclude](#include-and-revinclude). A [Module Configuration Library]({{site.data.fhir.ver.crmi}}/StructureDefinition-crmi-moduleconfigurationlibrary.html) can be used to supply per-server alternative queries.
* **Value set version differences.** When logic is sensitive to value set or code system versions, a [Version Manifest]({{site.data.fhir.ver.crmi}}/version-manifest.html) can be used to pin the specific versions used for a particular deployment, as described in the [Terminology Considerations](architectural-guidance.html#terminology-considerations) discussion.

A general pattern for managing these differences is to keep version-specific behavior out of the artifact logic and instead resolve it in the shared libraries (through compatibility functions) and the surrounding configuration (through module configuration and version manifests). This keeps the authored expressions stable while allowing the same artifact to be deployed against a heterogeneous set of servers.

### Common Search Parameter Filters

Many retrieves share the same routine post-retrieval filtering — for example, restricting observations to results that are `final`, `amended`, or `corrected`, or restricting resources to a particular status or category. Rather than repeating these filters in every expression, the shared libraries provide fluent functions that encapsulate the common cases.

For observations, these are described in the [Common Elements and Functions](patterns-observation.html#common-elements-and-functions) section of the [Observation Patterns](patterns-observation.html) topic, including:

* Status filters: [`resulted()`]({{site.data.fhir.ver.cql}}/Library-FHIRCommon.html#:~:text=define%20fluent%20function-,resulted,-%28observations%20List) (returns observations with a status of `final`, `amended`, or `corrected`), along with `final()`, `amended()`, and `corrected()`, and the corresponding singleton predicates `isResulted()`, `isFinal()`, `isAmended()`, and `isCorrected()`.
* Category filters: `.hasCategory(Code)`, `.isLaboratory()`, `.isVitalSign()`, `.isSurvey()`, and related helpers.

For example, retrieving only resulted laboratory observations is as simple as:

```cql
define "Resulted Laboratory Results":
  "All Laboratory Results".resulted()
```

In general, the `USCoreElements` library follows the convention of providing an `All Statuses` variant of each observation expression that returns observations regardless of status, alongside a default expression that applies `.resulted()`. This lets authors choose between the filtered and unfiltered forms without re-writing the underlying retrieve. Where a use case needs a different common filter, the same pattern — a small fluent function that expresses the filter once — should be followed and contributed back to the shared libraries.

<a name="extension-retrieval"> </a>
### Extension Retrieval

Many data elements that logic needs to access are represented as extensions rather than as first-class elements — for example, the US Core race, ethnicity, birth sex, and tribal affiliation extensions on `Patient`, or extensions defined by Da Vinci CRD/DTR. Accessing extensions directly through their canonical URLs is verbose and error-prone, so the shared libraries expose expected extensions as named fluent functions.

The `USCoreCommon` library defines these functions on top of the generic `ext()` and `exts()` fluent functions (which return a single extension or all extensions with a given URL, respectively). For example:

```cql
define fluent function birthSex(patient FHIR.Patient):
  patient.ext('http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-birthsex').value as FHIR.code
```

This allows logic to access the extension by name, without repeating the canonical URL or the value type cast:

```cql
define "Patient Birth Sex":
  Patient.birthSex()
```

`USCoreCommon` provides functions of this kind for the US Core patient extensions (`race()`, `ethnicity()`, `birthSex()`, `individualSex()`, `tribalAffiliation()`, `sexParameterForClinicalUse()`), as well as for other profile-specific extensions such as the PDMP prescription transmission method. Refer to the [US Core Common](Library-USCoreCommon.html) library for the complete set.

Guidance for extension retrieval:

* **Only rely on extensions that are expected to be present.** As with any element, an extension should only be depended upon when the profile marks it _must support_ or there is otherwise a reasonable expectation of its presence (see the [Element Considerations](patterns-overall.html#element-considerations) discussion). Extension accessors return null when the extension is absent, so logic must handle the null case.
* **Wrap expected extensions in a named function.** For extensions defined by other implementation guides that logic depends on — such as Da Vinci CRD coverage-information or DTR extensions — follow the same pattern of defining a fluent function that encapsulates the canonical URL and the value type. This keeps the canonical URL in one place, makes the logic readable, and localizes the impact if the extension definition changes across versions.
* **Use `exts()` for repeating extensions.** When an extension may appear more than once (for example, the `detailed` component of the race extension), use `exts()` to return all occurrences and process them as a list, as illustrated by the `race()` and `ethnicity()` functions.

### Complex Element Retrieval

Some data elements needed by an artifact are not stored directly as a single value but must be derived from other data, sometimes through non-trivial computation. To keep artifact logic focused and consistent, this guide provides reusable libraries and expressions for these complex derivations.

#### Cumulative Medication Duration

The total duration of a medication — accounting for dosage, timing, and dispense information — is a common but intricate calculation. The [Cumulative Medication Duration](Library-CumulativeMedicationDuration.html) library provides logic for computing cumulative medication duration from FHIR `MedicationRequest`, `MedicationDispense`, and `MedicationAdministration` resources, following the guidance established in the 5.6 version of the Quality Data Model.

Note that this logic assumes single-instruction dosing; split-dosing, tapering, and other more complex dosing instructions are not handled. As with all such patterns, care should be taken to ensure the data on which the logic runs conforms to this assumption.

#### Body Surface Area

Body Surface Area (BSA) is often needed for dosing and eligibility logic. Best practice is to prefer a recorded value when one is available, and only compute a value as a fallback. The `USCoreElements` library provides:

* [`"Most Recent BSA"`](Library-USCoreElements.html#:~:text=define%20%22Most%20Recent%20BSA%22): the most recent resulted `Body surface area` observation value, converted to `m2`.
* `CalculateBSA(algorithm, height, weight)`: computes BSA from height and weight using either the Mosteller or DuBois and DuBois formula, for use when no recorded observation is available.

An artifact can then combine these to prefer the recorded value and fall back to a calculation, for example:

```cql
define "BSA":
  Coalesce("Most Recent BSA", "Calculated BSA - Mosteller")
```

This pattern — retrieve the recorded value where present, compute only as a documented fallback, and make the computation method explicit — generalizes to other derived clinical values.
